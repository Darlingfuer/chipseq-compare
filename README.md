# Comparing differential transcription factor chip-seq methods

This repository holds some of my scripts and findings for comparing differential chip-seq methods (paper recently submitted).

* [DIME](DIME/) -- Some matlab code that I ported over to R. Method took too long to run so I gave up
* [MAnorm](MAnorm/) -- Rewrote most of this program so it runs faster, requires replicates, and uses edgeR
* [edgeR-DiffBind-DBChIP] -- I document how to use these three methods and some differences between them

MAnorm
======
MAnorm3 is my improved version.

Original can be found [here](http://bcb.dfci.harvard.edu/~gcyuan/MAnorm/R_tutorial.html) 
Published in [Genome Biology 2012](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22424423)

Workflow
--------
* StepI: clean and sort input
* StepII: classify common or unique peaks
* StepIII: count peak read
* StepIV: normalize using common peaks

Experience from running on a quad core workstation with 32gb of ram: 
* StepI is I/O bound (mostly reading from disk and writing back to disk)
* StepII & StepIII is CPU bound (lots of parallel bedtools)
* Ram usage I've seen with ENCODE datasets is 20gb+/-5gb but I dont actually think all of this is used for processing

Files
-----
MAnorm - original
MAnorm2 - v2 retains input/output compatibility w/original but will be faster and pools replicates
MAnorm3 - v3 has different input/output, uses edgeR with replicates

Problems with MAnorm
--------------------
* There is something wrong with how the p-values are calculated (see code in MAnorm2.R for details). 
  * pval calculation is not optimized (very slow)
    * It is faster to use `choose()` and run in parallel
  * Stirling approximation seems to be [done incorrectly](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/47997/unknown-p-value-calculation)
    * This calculation is consistant in matlab file (more details in matlab file than R file)
  * pval are not symmetric (calculations from x/y do not give the same pvalues as y/x)
* mergeBed command in MAnorm.sh does not actually work (need to sort first)
* Lots of tmp files generated by MAnorm.sh and a lot of steps could be done in parallel
  
Changes in v3
-------------
This version uses [edgeR](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) for significance testing.
* Requires a replicate (since [ENCODE samples](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ensembl/encode/integration_data_jan2011/byDataType/mappedReads/) have 2 reps)
* Run bedtools in parallel (faster unless you have IO bottleneck)
* Added parameter specify output directory
* MA adjustment is included as an offset to edgeR model
* sortBed before mergeBed command so the merged dataset is actually merged
* Requires input to be gzipped (will add switch for this later)
* Outputs a bunch of plots

Todo
----
* Contact MAnorm author about some of the issues in p-value calculation and merging
* Add error checks and helpeful diagnostic messages
* Add switch to check for .gz ending
* Change code so samples with no replicates can run

Changes in v2
-------------
This version tries to keep the same input/output as original MAnorm but has the following changes:
* I run bedtools in parallel in the background for significant speedup.
* Allows replicates (see 'read in' section of MAnorm2.sh code)
  * Concatenates replicates (proper way would be to downsample so replicates have equal weight)
  * Not well tested, use MAnorm3 if you have replicates


# Example of MAnorm3 run:
```bash
MAnorm3.sh peaks_folder \
  peaksA.bed.gz \
  peaksB.bed.gz \
  readsA1.bed.gz \
  readsA2.bed.gz \
  readsB1.bed.gz \
  readsB2.bed.gz \
  60 70 55 53
```
      
Where `60` `70` `55` `53` correspond to shift lengths (half of estimated fragment length) for `readsA1.bed` `readsA2.bed` `readsB1.bed` `readsB2.bed` 
and `readsA1` and `readsA2` are replicates used to identify peaks in `peaksA`. You must have MAnorm3.sh in your `$PATH` and MAnorm3.R must
be in current working directory (you could modify this in MAnorm3.sh). 

Second example:

    Usage: MAnorm3.sh foldername gr_peak.bed er_peak.bed gr_rep1.bed gr_rep2.bed er_rep1.bed er_rep2.bed 120 110 95 100

    gr_peak.bed: sample 1 significant peak list
    er_peak.bed: sample 2 significant peak list
    gr_rep1.bed: sample 1 raw reads rep1
    gr_rep2.bed: sample 1 raw reads rep2
    er_rep1.bed: sample 2 raw reads rep1
    er_rep2.bed: sample 2 raw reads rep2

    shifts (1/2 est fragment size):
    gr_rep1: 120
    gr_rep2: 110
    er_rep1: 95
    er_rep2: 100
